<p>In this experiment you will participate in an auction. You will be randomly assigned to a group of 3 bidders.
    Each bidder in your group will receive a randomly assigned value for the item auctioned.
    You will know your own value, but not the value of the other bidders.
    After you receive your value, the bidding process will begin.
    The winner of the auction will be the bidder who submitted the highest bid,
    but the price paid will be equal to the second highest bid of the 3 bids.
    The payoff for the auction will therefore be winner&rsquo;s assigned value less the price paid for the item.
    The other bidders will have a payoff of zero.
